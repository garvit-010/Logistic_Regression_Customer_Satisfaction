# Logistic_Regression_Customer_Satisfaction

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify data into two categories based on key features. The analysis explores the relationships between the features and the target variable to understand the factors influencing classification.

## Overview

- **Data**: The dataset includes multiple features that influence binary classification.
- **Objective**: Predict the class label (binary outcome) based on the feature set.
- **Approach**: Perform data exploration and build a logistic regression model to identify the significant predictors for classification.

## Features of the Project

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the relationships between features and the target variable using visualizations and summary statistics.

### 2. Model Building
- Train a logistic regression model using key features to predict the binary class label.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.

## Requirements

You will need to install the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into which features influence binary classification outcomes and uses a logistic regression model to predict these outcomes with accuracy.
